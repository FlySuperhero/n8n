# n8n Workflow - Cross-Platform Information Tracking System

This repository contains an n8n workflow designed to automate the process of tracking information across multiple platforms (such as 小红书, 抖音, YouTube, etc.). The project addresses the inefficiency of manually tracking and retrieving information from various platforms, aiming to create a unified and efficient entry point for information gathering.

## Project Background & Objective

To solve the issue of inefficiency in tracking information across platforms like 小红书, 抖音, YouTube, and others, this project aims to provide a seamless, automated solution. The goal is to create a unified system that allows users to efficiently gather, clean, and store content from different platforms into a single dashboard.

## Technical Solution & Implementation

1. **Data Source Integration**: 
   - The workflow utilizes **RSS Hub** as a middleware to convert unstructured content from various platforms into standardized RSS data streams. This allows for easy integration of different platforms.

2. **Workflow Automation**:
   - Using the **n8n** visual workflow automation tool, a comprehensive, fully automated workflow was designed and deployed. The workflow includes steps for:
     - **Data Scraping**: Collecting content from various sources.
     - **Data Cleaning**: Processing and filtering the collected data.
     - **Data Storage**: Storing the cleaned data for further use.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - The processed data is then pushed to a self-hosted dashboard (Notion). The dashboard provides:
     - **Content Categorization**: Organizing content into categories for easy navigation.
     - **Keyword Highlighting**: Identifying and highlighting important keywords in the content.
     - **Update Notifications**: Notifying users when new content is available or when updates occur.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Collects data from multiple platforms (e.g., 小红书, 抖音, YouTube) using RSS feeds.
- **Automation**: Full automation from data scraping to cleaning, filtering, and storing.
- **Custom Dashboard**: Visualize and organize the collected data with content categorization, keyword highlighting, and update alerts.

## Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, ensure you have:

- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) installed (either locally or in the cloud).
- **RSS Hub** instance set up to aggregate RSS feeds from the desired platforms.
- Relevant credentials for any third-party services the workflow uses (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens for Notion).
